Hi, my name is Anton. I'm working in the Huawei R&D center in Russia, Moscow. Together with my colleagues, we try to predict the future software development process and design new technologies that may help developers be more productive and make fewer errors. In our daily work, we extensively use Static Analysis and Machine Learning.

I believe that technologies helping humans to write code will take a significant part in software development in the future. I'm interested in the following research topics:

1. Automated Program Refinement
2. Neural Execution
3. Low Code / No Code
